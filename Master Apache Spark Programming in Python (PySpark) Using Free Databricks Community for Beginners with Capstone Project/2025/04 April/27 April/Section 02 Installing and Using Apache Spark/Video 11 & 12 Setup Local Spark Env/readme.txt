Q) What is shell in mac ? 

A) Shell is a program that takes commands from the user and gives them to the operating system to execute.
When you open Terminal and type something (ls, cd, python), the Shell is what reads your command, interprets it, and sends it to the OS.

Letâ€™s break this properly:

ðŸ“Œ First: What is .bash_profile and .zshrc?
They are just startup scripts where you set environment variables (JAVA_HOME, PATH, etc.).

They run automatically when you open a terminal.


Script	Belongs to
.bash_profile	Bash shell (older MacOS versions used this)
.zshrc	Zsh shell (newer MacOS versions use this)
