setting up local env to setup spark and do the work


 "On-Premise Platform" means:
The software or system is installed, run, and managed on the company's own physical servers, inside their own data centers â€” not on cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

ðŸ“š In simple words:
On-Premise = Your servers, your machines, your racks, your data center.

Cloud = Someone else's servers (like Amazonâ€™s, Googleâ€™s, Microsoft's) where you rent resources.
