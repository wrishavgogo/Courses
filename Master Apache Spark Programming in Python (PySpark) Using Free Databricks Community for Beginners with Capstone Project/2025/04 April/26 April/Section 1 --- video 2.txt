In database , or relational database we could store structed data , but as industry grew , 
so to process semi structed or unstructed data we needed Data lake 


Big Data problem , involves solving 3 main problems

1. Variety --> industry produces variety of data and we might want proper classification of these
2. Volume --> industry produces very high volume of data into the industry like PB of data very easily 
3. Velocity ---> The high velocity with which data is produced , like it fills PBs of data in the DB very fast 



Hadoop gives us 3 main things 

1. YARN -> this is cluster operating system ( managing CPU , schedulers , making the cluster seem like a single machine ) 
2. HDFS -> distributed file system 
3. MAP/REDUCE -> distributed computing ( we learnt abt this in our Designing Data Intensive Applications) 


DataBases V/s Hadoop 


Databases :- 

1. Data Storage
2. Sql query Language
3. Scripting Language
4. Programming Langugaes Interface 
5. only structed data


Hadoop :- 
1. Data Storage
2. Hive abstraction making HDFS seem like a database 
3. Apache PIG scripting
5. Semi and unstructed as well 

Databases :- still dominate for low to medium range of data 
Hadoop :- dominates for big data like PB of data and so
