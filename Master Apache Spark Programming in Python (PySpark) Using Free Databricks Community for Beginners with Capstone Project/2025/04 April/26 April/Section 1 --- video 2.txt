In database , or relational database we could store structed data , but as industry grew , 
so to process semi structed or unstructed data we needed Data lake 


Big Data problem , involves solving 3 main problems

1. Variety --> industry produces variety of data and we might want proper classification of these
2. Volume --> industry produces very high volume of data into the industry like PB of data very easily 
3. Velocity ---> The high velocity with which data is produced , like it fills PBs of data in the DB very fast 



Hadoop gives us 3 main things 

1. YARN -> this is cluster operating system ( managing CPU , schedulers , making the cluster seem like a single machine ) 
2. HDFS -> distributed file system 
3. MAP/REDUCE -> distributed computing ( we learnt abt this in our Designing Data Intensive Applications)
